# Image Curation

PonderImageCuration is an image processing pipeline which can take images as input and give the aligned faces as output along with put the images into a seperate folder in which face was undetected.

## General info
### `Folder details`:
* `facial_alignment_python` -> Only some image folder inside,nothing else.
* `quality_image_emotion_detection_facial_alignment` -> Facial alignment along with image quality control and emotion                                                               detection. 
* `images` -> Input image folder.
* `aligned_faces` -> Output image folder for aligned faces.
* `face_not_detected` -> Output image folder for undetected faces.


### `Brief introduction regarding the prameters/arguments`:
The following functions are supported:
* `predictor` : Download and use the appropriate facial landmark predictor model.

* `desiredLeftEye` : Coordinate of the left eye's position on the output aligned facial images.This controls how much face will be visible after the alignment process,menas used for zoomed in and out of the faces.
General range - 0-1,(<20% -> Zoomed in faces, >20% -> Zoomed out faces).

* `desiredFaceWidth` : Image width of the output aligned faces in pixels.

* `desiredFaceHeight` : Image height of the output aligned faces in pixels.

* `input_path` : You can select the path from which you are going to take the input images.

* `aligned_faces_path` : You can select the path in which you are going to save the aligned faces(output).

* `undetected_faces_path` : You can select the path in which you are going to save the images in which face was not detected(output).

## Dependencies

```bash
Python 3.5.2
OpenCV 4.0.0
Dlib 19.19.0
```

## Installation
Before using the code don't forget to install all the dependencies and packages.

## Model

* You can download the facial landmark model from the link below(choose which one you want to use,here I used 'shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks.dat') -

## Script_execution
#### 1. When working with python version of facial alignment(with image quality control and emotion recognition) only : - 

```bash
$ cd quality_image_emotion_detection_facial_alignment
```
For running the script for image quality control(the images must be of high quality,dimension > 800*800,othrewise the algotithm will reject it automatically) -
```bash
$ python quality_image_facial_alignment.py --shape_predictor ./models/shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks.dat 
--position_left_eye_X 0.3 --position_left_eye_Y 0.47 --image_width 600 --image_height 780 --input_path 'images/*.*' 
--aligned_faces_path 'aligned_faces/' --undetected_faces_path 'face_not_detected/'
```
For running the script for image quality control along with emotion detection(experimental only) -
```bash
$ python quality_image_emotion_detection_facial_alignment.py --shape_predictor ./models/shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks.dat --position_left_eye_X 0.3 --position_left_eye_Y 0.47 --image_width 600 --image_height 780 --input_path 'images/*.*' 
--aligned_faces_path 'aligned_faces/' --undetected_faces_path 'face_not_detected/'
```
